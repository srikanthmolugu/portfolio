Working:
	This project consists of two files namely port.css, port.html
	When you try to execute port.html file, you will be redirected to the webpage consisting of the attributes mentioned in port.html
	We mention a separate link in this html file which tells that it should use css attributes mentioned in port.css file
	This is nothing but acquring css attributes to our html page through external file.
	In our webpage it consists of images and some content related to it.
	When you click on the name of particular image you will be redirected to other page.
